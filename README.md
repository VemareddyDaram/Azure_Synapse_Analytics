# Housing in London - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores the housing market trends in London from 1995 to 2020 using two datasets provided by the UK government. The goal is to analyze how housing prices and other socio-economic factors evolved across London boroughs and compare them to other UK regions.

## Datasets Used

housing_in_london_monthly_variables.csv (13,549 rows × 7 columns): Contains monthly data on average house price, number of houses sold, crime rates, etc.

housing_in_london_yearly_variables.csv (1,071 rows × 12 columns): Includes yearly statistics like median salary, life satisfaction, population, jobs, and housing numbers.

## Key Questions Explored

1. How have average house prices and house sales changed over time in each borough?

2. Which factors most influence housing prices?

3. How does London compare to the rest of England?

## Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, GeoPandas

Azure Synapse Analytics

## Highlights

1. Time series visualization of average prices and houses sold

2. Correlation analysis between prices and socio-economic factors

3. Mapping borough-level trends using GeoPandas
